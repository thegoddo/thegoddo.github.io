                        state of Gujrat. He father was the dewan(Chief Minister) of Porbandar ; his deeply religious
                        mother was a devoted practitioner of Vaishnavism (worship of the Hindu god Vishnu), influenced
                        by Jainism, an ascetic religion governed by tenets of self-discipline and nonviolence.</p>

                    <p class="timeline__content-desc">At the age of 19, Mohandas left home to study law in London at the
                        Inner Temple, one of the city’s four law colleges. Upon returning to India in mid-1891, he set
                        up a law practice in Bombay, but met with little success. He soon accepted a position with an
                        Indian firm that sent him to its office in South Africa. Along with his wife, Kasturbai, and
                        their children, Gandhi remained in South Africa for nearly 20 years.</p>

                        regarding the registration of its Indian population, Gandhi led a campaign of civil disobedience
                        that would last for the next eight years. During its final phase in 1913, hundreds of Indians
                        living in South Africa, including women, went to jail, and thousands of striking Indian miners
                        were imprisoned, flogged and even shot.</p>

                        supported the British war effort in World War I but remained critical of colonial authorities
                        for measures he felt were unjust.</p>

                    <p class="timeline__content-desc">
                        In 1919, Gandhi launched an organized campaign of passive resistance in response to Parliament’s
                        passage of the Rowlatt Acts, which gave colonial authorities emergency powers to suppress
                        subversive activities. He backed off after violence broke out–including the massacre by
                        British-led soldiers of some 400 Indians attending a meeting at Amritsar–but only temporarily,
                        and by 1920 he was the most visible figure in the movement for Indian independence.

                        As part of his nonviolent non-cooperation campaign for home rule, Gandhi stressed the importance
                        of economic independence for India. He particularly advocated the manufacture of khaddar, or
                        homespun cloth, in order to replace imported textiles from Britain.

                        In 1930 launched a new civil disobedience campaign against the colonial government’s tax on
                        salt, which greatly affected Indian’s poorest citizens.

                    <h2 class="timeline__content-title">1931</h2>
                    <p class="timeline__content-desc">
                        In 1931, after British authorities made some concessions, Gandhi again called off the resistance
                        movement and agreed to represent the Congress Party at the Round Table Conference in London.
                        Meanwhile, some of his party colleagues–particularly Mohammed Ali Jinnah, a leading voice for
                        India’s Muslim minority–grew frustrated with Gandhi’s methods, and what they saw as a lack of
                        concrete gains. Arrested upon his return by a newly aggressive colonial government, Gandhi began
                        a series of hunger strikes in protest of the treatment of India’s so-called “untouchables” (the
                        poorer classes), whom he renamed Harijans, or “children of God.” The fasting caused an uproar
                        among his followers and resulted in swift reforms by the Hindu community and the government.

                        In 1934, Gandhi announced his retirement from politics in, as well as his resignation from the
                        Congress Party, in order to concentrate his efforts on working within rural communities.
                        Drawn back into the political fray by the outbreak of World War II, Gandhi again took control of
                        the INC, demanding a British withdrawal from India in return for Indian cooperation with the war
                        effort. Instead, British forces imprisoned the entire Congress leadership, bringing Anglo-Indian
                        relations to a new low point.

                    <p class="timeline__content-desc">
                        After the Labor Party took power in Britain in 1947, negotiations over Indian home rule began
                        between the British, the Congress Party and the Muslim League (now led by Jinnah). Later that
                        year, Britain granted India its independence but split the country into two dominions: India and
                        Pakistan. Gandhi strongly opposed Partition, but he agreed to it in hopes that after
                        independence Hindus and Muslims could achieve peace internally. Amid the massive riots that
                        followed Partition, Gandhi urged Hindus and Muslims to live peacefully together, and undertook a
                        hunger strike until riots in Calcutta ceased.

                        In January 1948, Gandhi carried out yet another fast, this time to bring about peace in the city
                        of Delhi. On January 30, 12 days after that fast ended, Gandhi was on his way to an evening
                        prayer meeting in Delhi when he was shot to death by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu fanatic enraged by
                        Mahatma’s efforts to negotiate with Jinnah and other Muslims. The next day, roughly 1 million
                        people followed the procession as Gandhi’s body was carried in state through the streets of the
                        city and cremated on the banks of the holy Jumna River.
