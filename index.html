        <p>At the age of 13, I stumbled upon the captivating world of computers, and it changed my life forever.
          Intrigued
          by the endless possibilities that these machines offered, I immersed myself in the realm of coding and
          programming. It was during this time that I was introduced to HTML, my first markup language. The thrill of
          crafting web pages and bringing designs to life using just a few simple tags ignited a passion within me that
          continues to drive my fascination with technology to this day. Learning HTML was like unlocking a door to a
          whole new universe, where creativity and logic converged in perfect harmony, and it marked the beginning of an
          incredible journey into the vast landscape of computer science.</p>
        <p>
          As I delved deeper into HTML, I marveled at the power of structuring content and creating beautiful,
          interactive
          web pages. With each tag and attribute, I found myself unraveling the intricacies of web development, and the
          satisfaction of seeing my creations come to life on the screen was unmatched. HTML became my gateway to
          understanding the fundamental building blocks of the internet, and it laid the groundwork for my ongoing
          exploration of various programming languages and technologies. The simple yet profound experience of learning
          HTML at such a young age embedded in me a deep-seated passion for coding and technology, shaping the
          trajectory
          of my future endeavors and cementing my love for the endless possibilities that the digital world has to
          offer.

          My biggest inspiration for my love of computer goes to Richard Freeman and Linux Torvald.
          They introduced me to the idea of Open Source Software.I started using Fedora, A Linux distro
          based on infamous Red Hat Linux.
        </p>

        <p>
          I learned many things by using linux like version control(git), bash scripting, Program Optimization and
          etc.

        As a teenager, I loved playing games which got my first hobby which is Drawing. I love drawing
        characters Japanese style called Anime Style.
        I have created many 4-koma or short funny comics, Which funnily enough nobody finds it funny so I didn't
        published it on web But one day.
      </p>

        My favorite game console is Nintedo DS. I have played many games like: Metroid, Tetris, Pokemon and
        etc.
        I am currently learning to create emulators so I can create my own NDS emulator. I can use already
        available emulators in the markedt.
        But since I am programmer and programmer's first goal is to program things. For now, I have only created
        a
        CHIP-8 emulator(I will publish the codes on github soon) and my next goal is GBA emulator.
        My favorite game console is Nintedo DS. I have played many games like: Metroid, Tetris, Pokemon and
        etc.

        I learned many low-level concepts such as Bit-masking, hexadecimals, Assembly and CPU clocks by building
        this emulator.
